Roadside memorials to be discussed

Kelowna City Council is being asked to do something about roadside memorials which, according to a Kelowna woman, can be distracting to drivers.

","

Suzanne St. Germain recently wrote council asking that something be done about a particular roadside memorial on Longhill Road in Glenmore.



""This memorial is particularly disgraceful and not in any way honouring the young man who lost his life there,"" says St. Germain in her letter.



""It has been there since December 2004/January 2005 and is covered with dirty, decaying remnants of clothing items, sun-bleached plastic flowers and more seem to litter the ground as well.""



St. Germain says the man who died at that spot and his family are from Vernon.



""It seems unlikely that anyone has visited it in years.""



In her letter, St. Germain says she believes a bylaw should be in place that would help respect the families grief while at the same time ""seeing they are removed after a certain designated time period by city workers.""



St. Germain point to a new program in Calgary where roadside memorials are allowed to stay for one year after which time they are replaced by a metal band called a 'Halo' (Honouring A Loved One).



""I am sending this to you in hopes Kelowna will start a similar program. I am hoping the Longhill memorial can at least be cleaned up and dignified somewhat.""



Mayor Sharon Shepherd is bringing up the matter at Monday morning's City Council meeting.","
""I'm not sure what the problem is with the memorials,"" said Kelowna City Councilwoman Mary Ann Kelleher.


""I think it's a distraction from the community. I think it's a distraction from the people who are driving,"" said Kelleher.

I am trying to make this work, as you can see it's a simple keyStroking where screen's a JPanel. The actions attackAction and pauseAction are defined before as global variables.
In windows everything works perfectly, however in mac it doesn't. No matter the key I press, it doesn't react. I also tried 
  screen.getInputMap().put(KeyStroke.getKeyStroke(' ',0),""attackAction"");

and
  screen.getInputMap().put(KeyStroke.getKeyStroke(' '),""attackAction"");

But I couldn't make it work. Not with ' ' or 'P' or any other sort of char. Anyone could bring some light?
Thanks,
Sergi.

After a lot of time working on it, I found out that if it worked on Mac it didn't on windows, and if it worked in windows it didn't on Mac. So, basically, java's multi-platform as long as the virtual machine's fine with it.

Maria Thorisdott","ir's late strike earned a thrilling derby victory as Chelsea hit back to end Arsenal's perfect start to the Women's Super League season.

The Gunners led when Vivianne Miedema's astute pass picked out Danielle van de Donk, whose shot found the far corner.

Chelsea deservedly levelled after the break, Beth England neatly turning the ball home from a Fran Kirby cut-back.

And substitute Thorisdottir curled in a stunning winner to take unbeaten Chelsea above Arsenal and into second.

Thorisdottir hit the ball first time from fellow sub Ramona Bachmann's 85th-minute pass to ensure a third Blues league win in four and move them to within two points of leaders Manchester City.

There were some nervy moments for the hosts late against a Gunners side who had won their past 11 league games stretching back to last season.

But Chelsea just about held out and celebrated in raucous style in front of a crowd of 4,149 at the full-time whistle.

Van de Donk's early goal was reward for a bright start by the champions in an open match, but Emma Hayes' side gradually got on top.

Ji So-Yun fizzed a shot narrowly wide and a fierce long-range Guro Reiten shot came back off the bar.

The pressure told when Kirby scampered away and found England with a clever pass soon after the restart.

Both sides pressed for a winner and had chances, but it was the home side who took the points thanks to an unlikely source in defender Thorisdottir.","ir, the former head coach of the Scottish National team, has been appointed as the new head coach of the Scottish National team.

Thorisdottir, who was appointed as the new head coach of the Scottish National team in January, will take over from the former head coach of the Scottish National team, Alex Neil.

Subject: Re: Document Retention  

Well, I'm not sure how responsive Dot's response was to your initial 
communication, but I agree that there is a 10 year retention policy on 
contracts and agreements and their backup.  This to me would only apply to 
all of the gas purchase contracts we pulled from storage, most of which are 
probably close to the end of the 10 years.  Litigation workpapers, which to 
me would include all of the pleadings, correspondence, discovery, exhibits, 
depositions, etc., have a six year retention.  The other documents we pulled 
from storage but didn't produce, such as Mike McGowan's and Mary Kay's old 
files on take-or-pay issues, FERC orders, etc., would have different 
retention policies depending upon their content.

2 questions :

- I assume if we produced an old 3-year plan, even though it should have been 
destroyed long ago, it would now fall under the 6 year litigation workpaper 
retention policy? 

-Do you think documents from the first trial have to ""start over"" and be kept 
for another 6 years?","

"<|endoftext|>Surveyor Nuclease: a new strategy for a rapid identification of heteroplasmic mitochondrial DNA mutations in patients with respiratory chain defects.
Molecular analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a critical step in diagnosis and genetic counseling of respiratory chain defects. No fast method is currently available for the identification of unknown mtDNA point mutations. We have developed a new strategy based on complete mtDNA PCR amplification followed by digestion with a mismatch-specific DNA endonuc","lease, Surveyor Nuclease. This enzyme, a member of the CEL nuclease family of plant DNA endonucleases, cleaves double-strand DNA at any mismatch site including base substitutions and small insertions/deletions. After digestion, cleavage products are separated and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The size of the digestion products indicates the location of the mutation, which is then confirmed and characterized by sequencing. Although this method allows the analysis of 2 kb mtDNA amplicons and the detection of multiple mutations within the same fragment, it does not lead to the identification of homoplasmic base substitutions. Homoplasmic pathogenic mutations have been described. Nevertheless, most homoplasmic base substitutions are neutral polymorphisms while deleterious mutations are typically heteroplasmic. Here, we report that this method can be used to detect mtDNA mutations such as m.3243A>G tRNA(Leu) and m.14709T>C tRNA(Glu) even when they are present at levels as low as 3% in DNA samples derived from patients with respiratory chain defects. Then, we tested five patients suffering from a mitochondrial respiratory chain defect and we identified a variant (m.16189T>C) in two of them, which was previously associated with susceptibility to diabetes and cardiomyopathy. In conclusion, this method can be effectively used to rapidly and completely screen the entire human mitochondrial genome for heteroplasmic mutations and in this context represents an important advance for the diagnosis of mitochondrial diseases.","lease (MEG) and a reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme.

"<|endoftext|>Evaluation of decellularized xenogenic porcine auricular cartilage as a novel biocompatible filler.
Fillers are products that fill the space in soft tissues of the human body and actively used in the various medical fields. Unfortunately, most of the cost-effective commercially available fillers are synthetic and have limitations in terms of their biocompatibility. Here, we evaluated the possible application of decellularized xenogenic cartilage as a long-lasting material for soft tissue augmentation and compared it with two commercially available fillers Artesense (polymethylmethacrylate microspheres) and Radiesse (calcium hydroxyapatite [CaHa]). To do so, porcine auricular cartilage was harvested, followed by freezing and grinding of the tissue into flakes. Then, we used 1% Triton X-100 to decellularize the flakes. We then, respectively, injected 0.1 cc of each material (decellularized xenogenic cartilage, Radiesse, and Artesense) into the subcutaneous layer at three different sites per subject in 12 Sprague-Daw","ley rats, and evaluated the inflammatory cell infiltration and foreign body reactions of each. Our data indicate that the infiltration of giant cells in the injection area was significantly lower in the decellularized xenogenic cartilage injection group than that in the Radiesse and Artesense injection groups. Further, we observed some neutrophil infiltration in the xenogenic cartilage and Artesense injection groups at 1 month, but these levels were much lower at 3 months (comparable to the Radiesse injection group). Thus, decellularized xenogenic cartilage may have a distinct advantage in terms of biocompatibility compared with other commercial injectable long-lasting fillers, making it one of the most feasible, natural, and cost effective materials in the market. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

"<|endoftext|>Brampton is set to receive more than $11 million in funding from the Ontario government to help fuel transit system expansion.

In an announcement on Tuesday (Dec. 19) at the city’s transit facility on Sandalwood Parkway, Minister of Transportation Steven Del Duca announced the provincial funding breakdown. He was joined by mayor of Brampton Linda Jeffery and Harinder Malhi, the MPP for Brampton-Springdale.

The funding is up from the $10 million Brampton received for the 2016-2017 year.

Brampton is among 105 municipal transit systems servicing 142 communities the Ontario government is supporting across the province with the Gas Tax Fund. First started in 2004, the fund has been working toward providing $3.7 billion to municipalities in Ontario to finance various transit projects that will ease congestion and lower air pollution. This year a total of $357 million was given in funding in Ontario. This is expected to grow to $642 million by 2021-2022.

“Brampton Transit is growing quickly and we have experienced extremely high ridership growth,” said Jeffery in a media release. Jeffery went onto say that an increase in demand in the city has made this investment into the transit system a necessity.

Brampton’s rapidly growing population has been a part of the demand increase Jeffrey spoke of.

In Canada’s latest census, it was revealed that Brampton’s population grew 13.3 per cent to 593,638 in 2016 from the 2011 census results that recorded the population at 523,906.

In previous years, Brampton used the funding to purchase new buses, improve service on existing lines and help fund the Brampton Rapid Transit service on Steeles Avenue.

The new funding will be focused on improving the existing transit system in Brampton after a council vote in 2015 shot down plans to extend the proposed Huront","ario LRT through city’s downtown area. This time around, the funding could mean more new buses, longer hours of service and more routes in Brampton.

Mississauga will also be receiving funding for public transit in the amount of $18 million, which is up from the $16 million that was released for the 2016-2017 year.","ario line to the city.

The new funding will be used to expand the Brampton Transit system to include more than 1,000 new stations, improve service on existing lines and improve service on existing lines.

The new funding will also help to fund the Brampton Transit system's expansion into the Greater Toronto Area.

“It’s like Starbucks,” she said. “There are pretzel chains in every neighborhood.” But older people stick to the tradition. “You see grandmas in the beer garden, having weisswurst and a pretzel at 11 a.m. with their first beer of the day,” she said.

In Baden-Württemberg, in southwest Germany near France and Switzerland, the pretzels are known for their fat “bellies” and skinny, intertwined arms. That’s the style at Prime Meats in Brooklyn; Frank Castronovo, an owner, learned to make pretzels there.

“The goal is to have two distinct eating experiences, one crunchy and one fluffy, in a single pretzel,” said Jeffrey Hamelman, director of the King Arthur Flour Baking Education Center in Norwich, Vt.

Mr. Hamelman’s first professional baking experience, in 1976, was an immersion course in pretzels. “I worked at a stellar German bakery in Northampton, Mass., when most Americans were still eating Wonder bread out of plastic bags,” he said. “The owner was German, but her bakers were French, and none of them wanted anything to do with pretzels. So she hired me just for that, and taught me all the secrets.”

The defining “secret” of pretzels is lye, a powerful alkali that gives them their defining contrast between a creamy white interior and a crunchy, dark-brown, lightly bitter crust. Just before baking, pretzels are dipped into a bath of water and lye, which transforms the starch on the surface so that it can brown quickly, while the interior remains moist. Cold lye solution can burn the eyes or skin, but the chemicals are neutralized by the heat of the oven.","aria and other cities are being forced to live in ""a world of fear and uncertainty.""

Windows/Mac: Unfortunately the iPhone and iPod touch lack the ability older iPods had to run in Disk Mode. That's where iPhone Explorer steps in, allowing you manually manage files on your device, or just use it as a flash drive, without jailbreaking.

iPhone browser is a lightweight application that has an easy drag-and-drop interface that lets you browse the contents on your iPhone. You can manually transfer your photos, music or movies from your device back to your computer, or just add files to the iPhone and fill up the unused space as extra storage. There's even an image preview for transferring photos. The best part about the whole thing, though, is that you don't need to jailbreak to use it. If you do have a jailbroken device, though, iPhone Explorer becomes even more useful—It can access the root of jailbroken phones and browse the files inside, with no need for complicated SSH setups.

","
The only issue I had was that multiple selection didn't work so well—whether I was trying to transfer files to or from my iPod touch, doing it one file at a time worked much better than trying to do more. So if you need to transfer large batches of files, you may be better off putting them in a folder beforehand to avoid crashes.

iPhone Explorer is a free download for Windows and Mac OS X 1.5+, requires iTunes 8 or 9 to use.

"<|endoftext|>ATLANTIC CITY -- On the same day Donald Trump officially secured the Republican nomination for president, his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton released another video calling his record into question, this time featuring a retired music store owner who says the one-time Atlantic City casino magnate partly stiffed him on a six-figure order decades ago.

The three-minute ""testimonial web video"" produced by Hillary for America stars Mike Diehl, a father of five who owned Freehold Music Center in 1989. In the video, Diehl says he received an order for pianos worth $100,000 from the Trump Taj Mahal casino.

Diehl waited more than a month after delivering the pianos before calling about the bill, stating he received a ""runaround at first."" Eventually, Diehl was told the casino did not have the money to pay the bill in full and was told he would have to accept 70 cents on the dollar or try his luck in bankruptcy court.

""I feel as if someone stole $30,000 from me,"" Diehl, 88, says in the video.

In public statements, Trump has boasted about his performance in the Atlantic City casino business, stating he pulled out of the resort city before it ""cratered.""

""I made a lot of money in Atlantic City. And I'm very proud of it,"" Trump said during the first GOP debate in August.

Diehl was among several people interviewed in an extensive USA Today article published earlier this month detailing Trump's record in Atlantic City, including the bankruptcy of the Taj Mahal, one of five times a Trump casino property filed for bankruptcy.

"<|endoftext|>Comparison of acid reduction in antiulcer operations.
Three acid-reducing operations have recently been described for the laparoscopic treatment of peptic ul","cer disease. These consist of a posterior truncal vagotomy combined with either (1) an anterior seromyotomy (SERO), (2) an anterior highly selective vagotomy (AHSV), or (3) a linear stapled lesser curvature excision (STAP). The purpose of this study was to investigate the physiologic effects of these procedures in terms of basal and maximal acid outputs. Fifty New Zealand rabbits were prospectively randomized into five open laparotomy groups (n = 10): a control group without vagal manipulation (CON), a bilateral truncal vagotomy with pyloromyotomy group (VP), a SERO group, an AHSV group, and a STAP group. All animals underwent placement of a gastrostomy tube for subsequent gastric secretory analysis. On postoperative day 6, basal acid outputs (BAO) and maximal acid outputs (MAO) following IV pentagastrin stimulation (30 microg/kg/h) were measured. Results were compared statistically using the ANOVA method. Pentagastrin stimulation was associated with a significant increase in MAO in the CON group (p < 0.05 vs BAO); however, this response was effectively blunted in all the experimental groups. There were no differences in BAO or MAO between any of the vagotomized groups (SERO, HSV, STAP, VP). We conclude that the three acid-reducing procedures modified for laparoscopy are equally efficacious in reducing gastric acid secretion and that they compare favorably with VP. To our knowledge, this is the first report comparing basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion between these new acid-reducing techniques.","cer.

How was Bifrost Bridge shattered in Ragnarok?

In the Ragnarok events (Marvel Comics), Bifrost Bridge is shattered. How did this happen?
Also, providing Bifrost isn't used to travel across realms in comics, what's the significance of this?

A:

In the comic universe, the Bifrost is what anchors Asgard and Midgard together. It's the primary means of travelling between those two worlds. There are other portals in Asgard to various other realms, including places like Olympus that are not part of the Nine Realms. The Bridge was the only permanent one, and allowed free passage in both directions (assuming you could get past Heimd","all.)
It should be noted that, in the comics, it's explicit that Asgard is a different dimensional plane than Midgard; some of the Nine Realms are on the same plane as Asgard, and thus can be reached via normal travel. Others, like Midgard and Jontunheim, are on their own planes, and need portals to reach them. In the MCU, there are strong indications that all Nine Realms exist in the same dimension, just different regions of the universe.
In keeping with the mythological meaning of Ragnarok, meaning the end of the world, the shattering of the Bifrost was part of the total desctruction of the Asgardian realm, sending all of the Asgardians into eternal sleep. Some, like Thor, are eventually reawakened, but the believe that Midgard is the only one of the Nine Realms left. I suspect that's not literally true, since Ragnarok is a cycle, not an event, though it's been claimed that Thor ""broke"" the cycle this last time. At the very least, though, Asgard as we knew it is unreachable from the Earth side.

"<|endoftext|>Henry Baker’s second tour of duty as a Rutgers football assistant was a short one, but he’s not going far

The Paterson native is expected to join the Giants' coaching staff as an assistant defensive backs coach, a person with knowledge of the hire told NJ Advance Media. The hire was first reported by Football Scoop; Baker is expected to replace Deshea Townsend, who recently took a job with the Bears.

Baker, who previously served a minority coaching internship with the Giants, is on the move again less than two months after he was re-hired as Rutgers' cornerbacks coach and pass game coordinator. Baker coached at North Carolina last season; he had previously served as Rutgers' cornerbacks coach in 2017.

Baker had signed a two-year contract paying him a base salary of $275,000 annually. Baker will owe Rutgers a $30,000 buyout fee in order to break the deal, which only became official on Jan. 2 of this year, according to contract details obtained by NJ Advance Media following an open records request.

Baker’s departure means head coach Chris Ash now has two openings to fill on his staff with about a month to go before the start of spring practice. Baker had replaced Cory Robinson on staff. Robinson, a Baltimore native, left Rutgers earlier this week after one season to take a job on new Maryland coach Mike Locksley’s staff, his old boss.

Rutgers' next cornerbacks coach will be its fourth different assistant to handle the position under Ash. Aaron Henry was an assistant defensive backs coach in 2016, but he focused on the corners while Bill Busch focused on the safeties. The next position coach will inherit a room with one returning starter - freshman Avery Young - as well as redshirt sophomore Tre Avery, who missed almost all of this past season due to injury but is expected to be a favorite to win the other starting job.

"<|endoftext|>Unsettling may be the kindest way of describing the presidential debate on Sunday night that often seemed like an extended ""Saturday Night Live"" skit filled with cringe-worthy moments.

Nolan Finley, head of The Detroit News' conservative editorial page, thought Donald Trump failed to do what he needed to reverse his fortunes following the release of a video in which Trump tells former ""Access"," Hollywood"" personality Billy Bush how stardom lets him take advantage of women.

Finley writes:

Destroyed. Dead. Done. That’s the status of Donald Trump’s campaign following the worst weekend for a presidential candidate ever. He walked onto the stage of Washington University in St. Louis Sunday night needing to erase his words captured on an 11-year-old videotape, strategically released to coincide with the debate, that served as a primer of sorts for molesting women. He didn’t deliver.

The second question of the evening, from moderator Anderson Cooper of CNN, went directly to the tape, asking Trump if he did the things he spoke of in the recording. Instead of a sincere apology and a plausible explanation, he dismissed it as locker room talk and quickly pivoted to a ramble about defeating ISIS and keeping America safe. The moment called for contrition and a convincing assurance that he was a changed man. Trump lost the night right there. He didn’t make the issue go away, and he also failed at his second mission — looking presidential.

The News has endorsed Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson.

Also read Stephen Henderson, editorial page editor at the Detroit Free Press: On Trump's divisive policies, Michigan GOP fails to lead:"," Hollywood"" host Billy Bush that he would ""never do anything like that again.""

""I think it's a very, very sad day for the country,"" Finley said. ""I think it's a very sad day for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country for the country"," Hollywood"" host Billy Bush that he is a ""bigot"" and that he should be impeached.

"<|endoftext|>Annual immunisation coverage report, 2010.
This, the fourth annual immunisation coverage report, documents trends during 2010 for a range of standard measures derived from Australian Childhood Immunisation Register (ACIR) data. These include coverage at standard age milestones and for individual vaccines included on the National Immunisation Program (NIP). For the first time, coverage from other sources for adolescents and the elderly are included. The proportion of children 'fully vaccinated' at 12, 24 and 60 months of age was 91.6%, 92.1% and 89.1% respectively. For vaccines available on the NIP but not currently assessed for 'fully immunised' status or for eligibility for incentive payments (rotavirus and pneumococcal at 12 months and meningococcal C and varicella at 24 months) coverage varied. Although pneumococcal vaccine had similar coverage at 12 months to other vaccines, coverage was lower for rotavirus at 12 months (84.7%) and varicella at 24 months (83.0%). Overall coverage at 24 months of age exceeded that at 12 months of age nationally and for most jurisdictions, but as receipt of varicella vaccine at 18 months is excluded from calculations, this represents delayed immunisation, with some contribution from immunisation incentives. The 'fully immunised' coverage estimates for immunisations due by 60 months increased substantially in 2009, reaching almost 90% in 2010, probably related to completed immunisation by 60 months of age being introduced in 2009 as a requirement for GP incentive payments. As previously documented, vaccines recommended for Indigenous children only (hepatitis A and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine) had suboptimal coverage at around 57%. Delayed receipt of vaccines by Indigenous children at the 60-month milestone age improved from 56% to 62% but the disparity in on-time vaccination between Indigenous and non-Indigenous children at earlier age milestones did not improve. Coverage data for human papillomavirus (HP",V)from the national HPV register are consistent with high coverage in the school-based program (73%) but were lower for the catch-up program for women outside school (30-38%). Coverage estimates for vaccines on the NIP from 65 years of age were comparable with other developed countries.,V) and pneumococcal vaccine were not available. The proportion of children 'fully immunised' at 12 months of age was higher for HPV vaccine (90.7%) than for pneumococcal vaccine (89.7%) and for HPV vaccine (89.7%) but this was not statistically significant. The proportion of children 'fully immunised' at 12 months of age was higher for HPV vaccine (90.7%) than for pneumococcal vaccine (89.7%) and for HPV vaccine (89.7%) but this was not statistically significant. The proportion of children 'fully immunised' at 12 months of age was higher for HPV vaccine (90.7%) than for pneumococcal vaccine (89.7%) and for HPV vaccine (89.7%) but this was not statistically significant. The proportion of children 'fully immunised' at 12 months of age was higher for HPV vaccine (90.7%) than for pneumococcal vaccine (89.7%) and for HPV vaccine (89.7%) but this was not statistically significant. The proportion of children 'fully immunised' at 12 months of age was higher for HPV vaccine (90.7%) than for pneumococcal vaccine (89.7%) and for HPV vaccine (89,"V) was not available for the first time, but the proportion of children 'fully vaccinated' at 12 months was 91.6%, 92.1% and 89.1% respectively. Coverage for pneumococcal at 12 months was higher than for pneumococcal at 12 months (89.1%) and for pneumococcal at 24 months (89.1%) but the gap was smaller for pneumococcal at 24 months (89.1%) and pneumococcal at 24 months (89.1%) and for pneumococcal at 24 months (89.1%) and for pneumococcal at 24 months (89.1%) and for pneumococcal at 24 months (89.1%) and for pneumococcal at 24 months (89.1%) and for pneumococcal at 24 months (89.1%) and for pneumococcal at 24 months (89.1%) and for pneumococcal at 24 months (89.1%) and for pneumococcal at 24 months (89.1%) and for pneumococcal at 24 months (89.1%) and for pneumococcal at 24 months (89.1%) and for pneumococcal at 24 months (89.1%) and for pneumococcal at 24 months (89"
"<|endoftext|>Selective reduction of hippocampal dentate frequency potentiation in aged rats with impaired place learning.
Induction of posttetanic potentiation (PTP) and long-term potentiation (LTP) was analyzed in hippocampal slices obtained from a) young 6-month-old Sprague-Daw","ley (SD) rats, all of them performing well in the Morris Maze, and b) aged SD 20-month-old and Fischer 344 24-month-old rats showing different degrees of ability in the same test. After the application of an electrical tetanus 1 s, 100 Hz, 50 microA in the stratum radiatum, no significant differences were found in the percent of induction of both PTP and LTP in the CA1 area of hippocampal slices obtained from rats of different strains and ages. After the application of an electrical tetanus 1 s, 100 Hz, 50 microA in the stratum moleculare, a significant difference was found in the percent of dentate PTP induction in hippocampal slices obtained from rats of different ages. Specifically, dentate PTP induction was significantly (p < 0.01) higher in slices obtained from young SD rats, and from old SD rats with a better performance in the Morris maze, escape latency less than 10 s and 150 cm, than in slices obtained from old SD or Fischer 344 rats that had shown poor performance in the Morris Maze. On the contrary, no significant differences were found in the percent of dentate LTP in hippocampal slices obtained from rats of different strains and ages. The data demonstrate that the induction of hippocampal dentate high-frequency PTP is selectively reduced in old rats with impaired Morris Maze performance.",ley rats (n = 6) and b) aged 6-month-old Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 6).

<|endoftext|>Effect of two prophylaxis methods on adherence of Streptococcus mut,"ans to microfilled composite resin and giomer surfaces.
Surface attributes of a restoration play an important role in adherence of plaque bacteria. Prophylaxis methods may be involved in modification of or damaging the restoration surface. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of two prophylaxis methods on adherence of Streptococcus mutans to the surface of two restorative materials. A total of 60 specimens were prepared from each material; a microfilled composite resin (HelioProgress) and a giomer (Beautifil II). For each material, the specimens were randomly divided into three groups (n=20). Group 1: no prophylaxis treatment (control); Group 2: prophylaxis with pumice and rubber cup; Group 3: prophylaxis with air-powder polishing device (APD). The surfaces of selected specimens from each group were evaluated under a scanning electron microscope (SEM), and the surface topography formed by the two prophylaxis methods was determined by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Adherence of Streptococcus mutans to the surface of specimens was determined by the plate counting method following immersion in a bacterial innoculum for 4 hours, rinsing and sonication. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA and post hoc Tukey test for multiple comparisons. Statistical significance was set at P<0.05. Bacterial adherence was significantly affected by both factors: restorative material type and prophylaxis method (P<0.0005). Mean bacterial adhesion was significantly higher in composite groups compared to corresponding giomer groups. Within each material, bacterial adherence was significantly lower in the control group compared to prophylaxis groups. Prophylaxis with pumice and rubber cup resulted in a significantly lower bacterial adherence compared to prophylaxis with APD. Based on the results of the present study, giomer specimens demonstrated lower bacterial adherence compared to composite resin specimens. In both materials, the highest bacterial adherence was observed with prophylaxis with APD, pumice and rubber cup and the control group, respectively.","ans to the oral cavity

"<|endoftext|>Complementary distributions of amyloid-beta and neprilysin in the brains of dogs and cats.
Neprilysin is an amyloid-beta-degrading enzyme localized in the brain parenchy","ma. The involvement of neprilysin in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease has recently received much attention. We examined the localization of neprilysin and amyloid-beta, as well as the activity of neprilysin, in the brains of dogs and cats of various ages to clarify the relationship between neprilysin activity and amyloid-beta deposition. The distribution of neprilysin was almost identical in dogs and cats, being high in the striatum, globus pallidus, and substantia nigra, but very low in the cerebral cortex. The white matter and hippocampus were negative. Neprilysin activity in the brain regions in dogs and cats was ranked from high to low as follows: thalamus/striatum > cerebral cortex > hippocampus > white matter. Amyloid-beta deposition was first detected at 7 and 10 years of age in dogs and cats, respectively, and both the quantity and frequency of deposition increased with age. In both species, amyloid-beta deposition appeared in the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus. In summary, the localization of neprilysin and neprilysin activity, and that of amyloid-beta, were complementary in the brains of dogs and cats.","ma.

The lipoprotein (Lp) pattern was analysed in patients with suspected unstable coronary artery disease (UCAD), to compare the pattern as a prognostic instrument regarding subsequent coronary events with smoking, hypertension, diabetes mell","itus and with the result of an early exercise test. Included were 295 patients with UCAD. Blood samples for Lp values were obtained in the acute phase and after one year. Apolipoprotein-A1, Apolipoprotein-B (Apo-B), Lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) HDL-Cholesterol, Cholesterol (Chol) and Triglycerides (TG). were estimated in serum. During the 1-year follow-up coronary events (myocardial infarction, cardiac death, coronary artery by-pass surgery) occurred in 48 patients. The severity of CAD, overweight, smoking and beta-blockade influenced the Lp-pattern. Chol-, TG- and Apo-B-levels were highest in the group with a coronary event. Apo-B turned out to be the second best predictive variable in multiple regression analysis, in men. In women no such analysis was done because of very few coronary events during follow-up. Nevertheless, the exercise test variables, ST depression and pain were more predictive of coronary events than Apo-B in men.","itus, and other risk factors.

The protein component of HAMLET is α-lactalbumin, which in its native state acts as a substrate specifier in the lactose synthase complex, thereby defining a function essential for the survival of lactating mammals. In addition, α-lactalbumin acquires tumoricidal activity after partial unfolding and binding to oleic acid. The lipid cofactor serves the dual role as a stabilizer of the altered fold of the protein and a coactivator of specific steps in tumor cell death. HAMLET is broadly tumoricidal, suggesting that the complex identifies conserved death pathways suitable for targeting by novel therapies. Sensitivity to HAMLET is defined by oncogene expression including Ras and c-Myc and by glycolytic enzymes. Cellular targets are located in the cytoplasmic membrane, cytoskeleton, mitochondria, proteasomes, lysosomes and nuclei, and specific signaling pathways are rapidly activated, first by interactions of HAMLET with the cell membrane and subsequently after HAMLET internalization. Therapeutic effects of HAMLET have been demonstrated in human skin papillomas and bladder cancers, and HAMLET limits the progression of human glioblastomas, with no evidence of toxicity for normal brain or bladder tissue. These findings open up new avenues for cancer therapy and the understanding of conserved death responses in tumor cells.","in receptor (LAR) is a major regulator of the immune system.

"<|endoftext|>SQL Tutorial

SQL tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of SQL. Our SQL tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals.

SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to perform operations on the records stored in the database such as updating records, deleting records, creating and modifying tables, views, etc.

SQL is just a query language; it is not a database. To perform SQL queries, you need to install any database, for example, Oracle, MySQL, MongoDB, PostGre SQL, SQL Server, DB2, etc.

What is SQL

SQL stands for Structured Query Language .

. It is designed for managing data in a relational database management system (RDB","MS).

It is pronounced as S-Q-L or sometime See-Qwell .

. SQL is a database language, it is used for database creation, deletion, fetching rows, and modifying rows, etc.

SQL is based on relational algebra and tuple relational calculus.

All DBMS like MySQL, Oracle, MS Access, Sybase, Informix, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server use SQL as standard database language.

Why SQL is required

SQL is required:

To create new databases, tables and views

To insert records in a database

To update records in a database

To delete records from a database

To retrieve data from a database

What SQL does

With SQL, we can query our database in several ways, using English-like statements.

With SQL, a user can access data from a relational database management system.

It allows the user to describe the data.

It allows the user to define the data in the database and manipulate it when needed.

It allows the user to create and drop database and table.

It allows the user to create a view, stored procedure, function in a database.

It allows the user to set permission on tables, procedures, and views.

<|endoftext|>Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) is a 125 kDa tyrosine kinase that is localized to contact points between cells and their extrace,"llular matrix. We have demonstrated that FAK overexpression and upregulation occurred in early stages of tumorigenesis. We have also shown that FAK overexpression suppresses apoptosis, thus providing a survival signal to human cancer cells. Furthermore, our data has recently shown that the amino-terminus of FAK can induce apoptosis in breast cancer cells and can bind to a death domain containing serine-threonine kinase, Receptor Interacting Protein, (RIP). In addition, we have identified peptides that bind to the carboxy-terminus of FAK and cause apoptosis. 1 of these peptides contained a sequence homologous to the vascular endothelial growth receptor 3 (VEGFR-3) protein that we have shown to bind FAK. This proposal focuses on the biology of FAK in the development of cancer and on the biological mechanism by which attenuation of amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal FAK signaling causes tumor cell apoptosis. The first specific aim is to define the critical components of the amino terminus of FAK (FAKNT) that are responsible for its pro-apoptotic properties. We will define the portion(s) of FAK-NT that induce loss of adhesion in breast cancer cells and bind to RIP. Next, we will perform functional analyses of different peptides that bind the carboxy-terminus of FAK (FAK-CD), inhibit FAK function, and induce apoptosis in breast cancer cells. We will define their biological effects in different tumor cell lines to determine if they can induce apoptosis, perform initial binding studies using NMR spectroscopy, and perform site directed mutagenesis to determine which amino acids are critical for interaction with FAK-CD. Finally, we will define the physical interaction between FAK and VEGFR-3, determine the mechanism of survival signaling mediated by this interaction, and examine the relationship between levels of expression of FAK and VEGFR-3 in translational studies of primary human breast cancers. By defining the mechanism of interaction between FAK and its critical binding partners, we will identify novel sites for molecular targeting to induce apoptosis in human breast cancer cells.",llular matrix.

Campaigners are ­calling to ban 16-year-olds joining the armed forces.

They will use tomorrow’s International Day Against The Use of Child Soldiers to highlight the issue with the Government.

Stats show more than 2,000 under-16s sign up each year, with 80 per cent going to the Army.

An early day motion ­tabled by Plaid Cymru MP Liz Saville Roberts says: “Westminster must ­seriously consider its policy of recruiting 16-year-olds into the armed forces and recognise the deep ­emotional, physical and psychological damage this does to them.

(Image: Anadolu)

“Fewer than 20 countries in the world allow their armed forces to recruit 16- year-olds – including the likes of Iran and North Korea. We shouldn’t be part of this group.

“A government that ­believes it is morally ­acceptable to stop a 16-year-old from buying glue, yet is happy to teach them how to kill with a ­bayonet has clearly mislaid its moral compass.”

She said child recruits are more susceptible to post-traumatic stress disorder, alcohol abuse and even committing suicide.

Stats show the UK is the only European country that recruits 16-year-olds into the armed forces with ­under 18s accounting for 22.3 per cent of all Army recruits at end of 2016.

The other countries where 16-year-olds can join the armed forces include – Mauritania, Pakistan, El Salvador, UAE, Zambia, Egypt, Bangladesh, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Iran, Tonga, Trinidad & Tobago and Papua New Guinea."," notice Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email

<|endoftext|>Prognostic significance of serum lactate dehydrogenase level in osteosar,"coma: a meta-analysis.
A number of studies have investigated the role of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level in patients with osteosarcoma but have yielded inconsistent and inconclusive results. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis to assess its prognostic value more precisely. Systematic computerized searches of PubMed, Embase and Web of Science databases were performed. The pooled hazard ratio (HR) with 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) of overall survival was used to assess the prognostic role of serum LDH level. Ten studies published between 1997 and 2013 with a total of 943 osteosarcoma patients were included. Overall, the pooled HR for all ten eligible studies evaluating high LDH level on overall survival was 1.92(95 % CI 1.53-2.40). Sensitivity analysis suggested that the pooled HR was stable and omitting a single study did not change the significance of the pooled HR. Funnel plots and Egger's tests revealed there was some possibility of publication bias risk in the meta-analysis. This meta-analysis shows that high serum LDH level is obviously associated with lower overall survival rate in patients with osteosarcoma, and it is an effective biomarker of prognosis.","coma patients with osteosarcoma

"<|endoftext|>Maturational differences in hepatic microhemodynamics in rats.
Age-related changes in the hepatic microcirculation may contribute to the increased susceptibility of the immature liver to microvascular injury. We quantified sinusoidal and acinar diameters, sinusoidal red cell velocities (VRBC), and sinusoidal volume flows to characterize microhemodynamics of weanling and adult rat livers with and without hepatic artery (HA) ligation using intravital fluorescence videomicroscopy. Despite a 20% faster heart rate and a nearly 20% lower mean arterial and portal vein pressure in weanling rats relative to those in the adults, weanling periportal and pericentral sinusoidal velocities were approximately 30 and 25% faster, respectively, than those in adults. Furthermore, the HA was found to contribute more to maintenance of sinusoidal VRBC in the immature liver as demonstrated by a significant decrease in both periportal and pericentral VRBC following HA ligation. HA ligation had no effect on VRBC of either zone in adults. Zonal volume flow (HA intact), however, was maintained independent of age. These results suggest a lower extrasinusoidal resistance in the weanling. The 25% shorter acinar diameter that we found in weanling livers likely contributes to a lower extrasinusoidal resistance by allowing a higher ratio of inflow vessels to volume of tissue. Shorter sinusoidal pathways in weanling livers also decreases sinusoidal resistance 1.3-fold relative to that in the adult, countering the approximately 1.5 times increase in resistance due to the smaller caliber of sinusoidal vessels so that overall sinusoidal resistance is not age-dependent.(ABSTRACT TRUNC",ATED AT 250 WORDS),"ATED AT 250 WORDS).

Radionuclide cisternography is indicated in the clinical work-up for hydrocephalus, when searching for CSF leaks, and when testing whether or not intracranial cystic lesions are communicating with the adjacent subarachnoid space. This paper demonstrates the feasibility and diagnostic value of SPECT and subsequent 3D surface rendering in addition to conventional rectilin","ear CSF imaging in eight patients. Planar images allowed the evaluation of CSF circulation and the detection of CSF fistula. They were advantageous in examinations 48 h after application of 111In-DTPA. SPECT scans, generated 4-24 h after tracer application, were superior in the delineation of basal cisterns, especially in early scans; this was helpful in patients with pooling due to CSF fistula and in cystic lesions near the skull base. A major drawback was the limited image quality of delayed scans, when the SPECT data were degraded by a low count rate. 3D surface rendering was easily feasible from SPECT data and yielded high quality images. The presentation of the spatial distribution of nuclide-contaminated CSF proved especially helpful in the area of the basal cisterns.","ear imaging.

<|endoftext|>Repolarization of the presynaptic action potential and short-term synaptic plastic,"ity in the chick ciliary ganglion.
Stimulation-induced increases in synaptic efficacy have been described as being composed of multiple independent processes that arise from the activation of distinct mechanisms at the presynaptic terminal. In the chick ciliary ganglion, four components of short-term synaptic plasticity have been described: F1 and F2 components of facilitation, augmentation, and potentiation. In the present study, intracellular recording from the presynaptic calyciform nerve terminal of the chick ciliary ganglion revealed that the late repolarization and afterhypolarization (AHP) phases of the presynaptic action potential are affected by repetitive stimulation and that the time course of these effects parallel that of facilitation. The effects of these changes in the presynaptic action potential time course on calcium influx were tested by using the recorded action potential waveforms as voltage command stimuli during whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from acutely isolated chick ciliary ganglion neurons. The ""facilitated"" action potential waveform (slowed repolarization, decreased AHP amplitude) evoked calcium current with slightly but significantly greater total calcium influx. Taken together, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that activity-dependent changes in the presynaptic action potential are one of several mechanisms contributing to the facilitation phase of stimulation-induced increases in transmitter release in this preparation.","ity in the hippocampus is a key component of the neurobiology of schizophrenia. We investigated the effects of a novel antidepressant on the presynaptic action potential of the hippocampus in healthy volunteers. We found that the antidepressant treatment significantly reduced the number of synaptic connections in the hippocampus, and that the antidepressant treatment significantly reduced the number of short-term connections in the hippocampus. These results suggest that the antidepressant treatment may be effective in the treatment of schizophrenia.<|endoftext|>","ity is a key component of the neuroendocrine system.

OTTAWA — The government’s omnibus crime bill was being pushed through its final test in the Senate for no good reason, Liberal senators charged Thursday.

Their words, however, were unable to change the trajectory of the bill’s path to becoming law, as the Conservatives used their majority in the Senate to give final approval — by a vote of 48 to 37 — to the bill before it returns to the House of Commons.

Once in the Commons, MPs would have to approve the six changes Conservative senators made to the bill that more clearly define terrorism activities and how victims of terrorism can sue groups or states that support terrorism.

Bill C-10, the Safe Streets and Communities Act, passed its final vote in the Senate at about midnight Friday.

"<|endoftext|>Significance of early tubular extraction in the first minute of Tc-99m MAG3 renal transplant scintigraphy.
Renal transplant perfusion curves obtained using Tc-99m MAG3 differ from those with Tc-99m DTPA. The perfusion curve can be divided into a first phase (up to the first-pass peak) and a second phase (the curve after the initial peak). The second phase of the MAG3 perfusion curve is usually ascending in contrast to the descending Tc-99m DTPA curve. This ascending MAG3 curve reflects early tubular extraction of MAG3. However, the second phase of the MAG3 curve is sometimes flat or descending. We hypothesized that a flat or descending curve reflects poor early tubular extraction and therefore graft dysfunction. Ninety-two studies of 59' renal transplant patients were retrospect","ively reviewed. The second phase of the perfusion curve was visually classified as ascending, flat, or descending. 77.2% of studies had ascending curves, 16.3% flat curves, and 6.5% descending curves. A descending curve had a positive predictive value (PPV) of 100% for medical graft dysfunction, while a flat curve had a PPV of 93.3%. A nonascending second phase curve was specific (96.4%) but not sensitive (33.9%) for graft dysfunction. Patients with acute tubular necrosis were not significantly more likely to have a nonascending curve than those with acute rejection. There was no significant difference in creatinine level between patients with medical graft dysfunction and ascending vs. nonascending curves. A nonascending second phase Tc-99m MAG3 perfusion curve is predictive for graft dysfunction. An ascending curve is nonspecific and can be seen in both normally and poorly functioning grafts.","ively reviewed.

Objective To determine the effect of early tubular extraction on the first-pass peak of the MAG3 perfusion curve.

Design, Setting, and Participants The MAG3 perfusion curve was obtained from a Tc-99m MAG3 donor.

Main Outcome Measures The MAG3 perfusion curve was obtained from a Tc-99m MAG3 donor.

Results The MAG3 perfusion curve was significantly higher in the first phase of the MAG3 perfusion curve compared with the descending Tc-99m DTPA curve.

Conclusions The MAG3 perfusion curve reflects early tubular extraction of MAG3. However, the second phase of the MAG3 curve is sometimes flat or descending.

A behavioral model of dopaminergic function in the rat was used to examine the anticataleptic effects of L-prolyl-L-leucyl-glycinamide (PLG) and peptidomimetic analogs of PLG. Administration of 1 mg/kg PLG intraperitoneally significantly attenuated haloperidol (1 mg/kg)-induced catalepsy (as measured by the standard horizontal bar test), whereas doses of 0.1 and 10 mg/kg PLG did not. Eight synthetic PLG peptidomimetics (Calpha, alpha-dialkylated glycyl residues with lactam bridge constraint [1-4] and without [5-8]) were tested in the same manner (at a dose of 1 microg/kg) and categorized according to their activity, i.e. very active (5), moderately active (2, 3, 4, and 6), and inactive (1, 7, and 8). The catalepsy-reversal action of the diethylglycine-substituted peptidomimetic 5 was examined further and found to exhibit a U-shaped dose-response effect with an optimal dose of 1 microg/kg. The similarity between the effects of PLG and the synthetic peptidomimetics suggests a common mechanism of action. Finally, the synthetic peptidomimetics examined here, particularly peptidomimetic 5, were more effective than PLG in attenuating haloperidol-induced catalepsy.","idol metabolism in rats. J.

We compared a group of 60 insulin-dependent diabetics maintained on CAPD with 60 nondiabetic matched controls to determine if the diabetic patients were at increased risk for catheter-related infections. Although catheter infection rates were 17% higher in the diabetics (1.4/year versus 1.2/year in nondiabetics), time to first catheter infection was not different between the groups (p = 0.6). Rates of peritonitis, peritonitis associated with catheter infection, multiple catheter infection, and catheter removal were also similar among the diabetics and controls. S. aureus caused 52% (42/81) of the catheter infections in the diabetics and 60% (35/58) in the controls. More catheter infections in the nondiabetics versus the diabetics lacked drainage or resulted in sterile cultures (17/75 versus 7/88 respectively, p less than or equal to 0.01), but the significance of this finding is uncertain. In conclusion, we did not find insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus to be a statistically significant risk factor for catheter-related infections.","al insulin infusion (ICI) have been reported in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

"<|endoftext|>Oracle SQL Hints --- Abstraction

SQL HINT description and demonstration

SQL Hint is one of most important approaches to change the activity of optimizer and SQL execution, it’s also pretty important for SQL tuning. For instance, HINT is a part of the SQL Profiler advised by SQL Tuning Advisor. In each Oracle version, corresponding to the SQL features changes, new hints will be introduced, and old hints may be obsolete. Oracle introduced a new dynamic view, V$SQL_HINT, to show in which version the hint was involved in, and in which version it began work as outline data. The hints are associated with special SQL features. It will work only if the related features are enabled. Take HASH_AJ for example, it’s a CBO (QKSFM_CBO) feature hint, and it will not work if the SQL optimizer mode is set to RBO.

Some hints are only effect in the internal recursive SQLs, cannot be used in user SQL directly.

The embedded hints in SQL are a piece of comment, with the format /*+ <hint 1> [<hint 2> ...]*/. One comment may involve multiple hints, and one SQL may also involve multiple hint comments. And the hint will work only if they exist in the comment following the key words, SELECT, UPDATE, INS","ERT, MERGE and DELETE. If the SQL is a complex query involved in sub-query, the hint could be written as global or local format.The local format hints exist in the sub-query, and it can only affect the sub-query. While the global format hits exist in the main part of the query, it can be specified to affect any object in whole query by adding <object>@<block>. The alias could be used to replace the object name.

Tip: Since the embedded SQL hint is a piece of comment, its format could also be --+<hint>. For example,

HELLODBA.COM>select --+full(u)

2 * from t_users u where user_id =1;

We will descript all of hints, and also give demonstration of their usage.

"<|endoftext|>Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is an opportunistic gram-negative pathogen responsible for a large number of nosocomial infections. Dr. Joanne Engel and her group have shown that PA103 induces apoptotic-like cell death in epithelial cells and macrophages by a Type III Secretion System (TTSS)-dependent mechanism. Consistent with the results of others, They have found this to be a Fas ligand- and Fas receptor-dependent process. We propose that PA-induced apoptosis occurs either by (A) direct translocation of a bacterial effector into the host cell (PAF, for Pseudomonas Apoptosis Factor) by the TTSS, resulting in activation of Fas-dependent apoptosis or by (B) direct induction of Fas-dependent apoptosis by one or more components of the type III translocation apparatus itself. We will identify the mechanism by which PAl03 induces TTS-dependent apoptotic-like cell death in eukaryotic cells. We will initially use genetic and proteomic approaches to identify a put",ative apoptosis-inducing type III secreted effector molecule. We may also test the alternative hypothesis that the TTSS itself is responsible for the induction of apoptosis by PA. We will express the PA TTSS in a Yersinia strain that lacks the plasmid encoded TTSS and test for restoration of apoptosis-inducing activity.,"ative mechanism by which PA-induced apoptosis is induced by the TTSS.

The role of PA in the pathogenesis of nosocomial infections is well established.

Locoregional therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are considered to confer a survival advantage, however, the patient group that should be targeted is not clearly defined. This study aimed to determine the impact on survival of locoregional therapies compared with supportive care, within prognostic categories as stratified by the Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) scoring system. A prospective database was used to identify those patients who were treated with either locoregional therapy (n = 128) or supportive care (n = 92). Survival analysis was performed for groups matched by CLIP score at presentation. Comparison of important prognostic factors was undertaken and univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to assess determinants of survival. Use of locoregional therapies was only associated with a survival benefit in patients with a CLIP score of 1 or 2. In this group, the median survival in patients who received locoregional therapies was 25.0 months (95% confidence interval 22.7-27.4) compared with 8.9 months (95% confidence interval 7.3-10.5) for supportive care (P = 0.001). For patients with CLIP scores of 3 or greater, no survival benefit of locoregional therapies was observed. Multivariate analysis revealed locoregional intervention, CLIP score, tumor symptoms, alpha-fetoprotein level, bilirubin and alkaline phosphat",ase level as independent prognostic indicators. Locoregional therapies should be targeted specifically to patients with non-advanced hepatocellular carcinoma as assessed by validated scoring systems. Use of these therapies in patients with advanced disease does not appear to be associated with a survival benefit and may expose patients to unnecessary harm.,"ase levels, and survival advantage were not associated with survival advantage.

"<|endoftext|>Increases of CRF in the amygdala are responsible for reinstatement of methamphetamine-seeking behavior induced by footshock.
Recent evidence suggests the involvement of corticotrop","in-releasing factor (CRF) in drug abuse. Here, we evaluated whether CRF modulates the reinstatement of methamphetamine (METH)-seeking behavior induced by stress using a drug-self administration paradigm in rats. Rats were trained to lever-press for intravenous METH (0.02 mg/infusion) accompanied by light and tone (drug-associated cues) and then underwent extinction training (saline substituted for METH without cues). Under the extinction condition, the inhibitory effects of a CRF receptor antagonist on the stress-induced reinstatement of METH-seeking behavior were assessed. Anxiety-like behaviors during METH withdrawal in METH self-administered rats were also evaluated. The non-selective CRF receptor antagonist α-helical CRF(9-41) attenuated METH-seeking behavior induced by footshock stress. CRF levels both in the amygdala and in plasma were significantly increased on day 10 of withdrawal after METH self-administration. However, plasma corticosterone concentrations were unchanged during the withdrawal. In addition, METH-seeking behavior was not affected by an inhibitor of corticosterone synthesis, metyrapone. In the elevated plus maze test, METH self-administered rats showed a decrease in the duration of time spent in the open arms on day 10 of withdrawal. The increased CRF levels in the amygdala may, at least in part, contribute to the footshock-induced reinstatement of METH-seeking behavior and the increase in anxiety-like behavior.

"<|endoftext|>Benign essential blepharospasm (BEB) and spasmodic torticollis (ST) are progressive forms of focal dystonia characterized by their unique presentation in upper facial musculature and cervical musculature, respectively. Little is known about the role of the cerebral cortex despite the fact that emotional and stress-related events, behaviors regulated by the cerebral cortex, often trigger and exacerbate these disorders. Furthermore, cortical control of lower motor neurons innervating muscles implicated in these movement disorders is poorly understood. This study is designed to isolate for the first time cortical neural systems that directly innervate facial motor neurons selectively engage in BEB and spinal accessory motor neurons selectively engage in ST. Once identified, synaptic interactions of these neuronal assemblies will be anatomically characterized. The major goals of this project are to examine the corticobulbar projection from the face/neck representation of the cingulate motor cortex (M3 or Area 24c) to the facial and spinal accessory nuclei. The investigators will determine if the M3 projection: 1) targets lower motor neurons innervating the orbicularis oculi, corrugator supercilia, frontalis, sternocleidomastoid and trapezius; 2) makes direct contact with these motor neurons; 3) is excitatory or inhibit","ory. Their studies are designed to test the hypothesis that the cerebral cortex plays a role in the physical expression of BEB and ST. It is further hypothesized that recruitment of musculature in BEB and ST patient is a consequence of neuroplastic alterations, such as local sprouting. This project will lead to an increased understanding of cortical systems governing upper facial expression and cervical torsion. These data will be used to design a cortical model of focal dystonia and provide guidance in developing new approaches to surgical treatment of intractable cranial-cervical dyskinesias.","ory; 4) is associated with the facial and spinal accessory nuclei; 5) is associated with the facial and spinal accessory nuclei; and 6) is associated with the facial and spinal accessory nuclei.

year has once again hit out the congress party. Without mentioning the on-going Rafale controversy, P M Modi accused the Congress of indulging in mud- slinging against the government and running away from debating issues of development with the government.

The Prime Minister tweeted about his scheduled engagement in Bhopal

Looking forward to interacting with the hardworking Karyakartas of @BJP4MP at the #KaryakartaMahakumbh in Bhopal today. https://t.co/ZxPSqlIoxJ — Narendra Modi (@nare","ndramodi) September 25, 2018

Modi took a did at the Congress saying the 125-year-old party has been reduced to such a condition that it is “begging” with small parties for alliances.

He said even if the Congress gets allies, the coalition will not be successful. Modi said his government believes in social justice for all and that its ‘Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas’ (cooperation of all, development of all) campaign is not just a slogan.

He expressed confidence that the BJP would emerge victorious in the upcoming Assembly polls in Madhya Pradesh as well as in the Lok Sabha elections next year.","ndramodi) May 24, 2017

"<|endoftext|>[Vitamin K deficiency in patients with CF despite supplementation].
Cystic fib","rosis (CF) patients are at high risk for vitamin K deficiency. Vitamin K supplementation dose has not been clearly defined, and the effects of the supplementation are very ambiguous. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to assess body resources of vitamin K and determine the suitability of the coagulation parameters in the assessment of vitamin K deficiency in patients undergoing supplementation. The study comprised 30 CF patients aged from 1.5 to 32 years. In all patients, the concentration of the undercarboxylated prothrombin (prothrombin induced by vitamin K deficiency--PIVKA-II), as a marker of vitamin K deficiency, was estimated. For comparison of the diagnostic value of existing methods of assessment of vitamin K status, the coagulation parameters were evaluated (prothrombin ratio and INR). In spite of applied supplementation vitamin K status was not normal in all CF patients. Increased PIVKA-II concentrations (3.3-97 ng/ml) were found in 8 out of 30 (26.7%) patients, when the cut-off value of 2 ng/ml was used. Abnormal PIVKA-II levels corresponded to pathological values of the coagulation parameters only in one patient. In the remaining 7 CF subjects with increased concentration of the undercarboxylated prothrombin, coagulation parameters were normal. Vitamin K deficiency occurs in CF patients despite applied supplementation. The accurate supplementation dose should be estimated individually and the assessment of its effectiveness requires studies allowing to determine the real body resources of vitamin K. The coagulation parameters are not a good indicator of vitamin K deficiency.","rosis (CF) is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the lungs, liver, and kidneys.

"<|endoftext|>Structural requirements for the growth factor activity of the amino-terminal domain of urokinase.
High molecular weight urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) in which proteolytic activity was inactivated (diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP)-uPA), its amino-terminal fragment (ATF, amino acids (aa) 1-143), and fucosylated and defucosylated growth factor domains (GFD, aa 4-43) were tested for growth-promoting effects and binding in human SaOS-2 osteosarcoma cells and U-937 lymphoma cells. DFP-uPA, ATF, and both the fucosylated and defucosylated GFD were capable of competing with 125I-ATF for binding to both SaOS-2 and U-937 cells. DFP-uPA, ATF, and fucosylated GFD were also mitogenic in SaOS-2 cells and increased cell numbers. However, defucosylated GFD was nonmitogenic in SaOS-2 cells and did not stimulate cell proliferation, even though it bound to these cells in a manner equivalent to the fucosylated GFD. A nonglycosylated high molecular weight uPA expressed and purified from Escherich","ia coli inhibited 125I-ATF binding to SaOS-2 cells but was also nonmitogenic. No mitogenic activity was observed in U-937 cells treated with the uPA forms capable of eliciting a mitogenic response in SaOS-2 cells. Proteolytically prepared kringle domain (aa 47-135) and low molecular weight uPA (aa 144-411) did not compete for 125I-ATF binding and did not elicit any mitogenic response in either of the cell lines tested. In addition, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), which has been shown to be homologous to uPA in its growth factor domain and is also fucosylated, did not inhibit 125I-ATF binding nor elicit any mitogenic response. These results demonstrate that the GFD, implicated in binding to the uPA receptor, is also responsible for growth factor like activity in SaOS-2 cells and that the fucosylation at Thr18 within this domain may serve as a molecular trigger in eliciting this response.",ia coli and human SaOS-2 osteosarcoma cells was also found in human SaOS-2 osteosarcoma cells.

"<|endoftext|>Expression, regulation and biological actions of growth hormone (GH) and ghrel","in in the immune system.
Immune and neuroendocrine systems have bidirectional communications. Growth hormone (GH) and an orexigenic hormone ghrelin are expressed in various immune cells such as T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, monocytes and neutrophils. These immune cells also bear receptors for hormones: growth hormone receptor (GHR) for GH and growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R) for ghrelin. The expression of GH in immune cells is stimulated by ghrelin as in anterior pituitary cells, whereas the regulation of GH secretion in the immune system by other peptides seems to be different from that in the anterior pituitary gland. Cytokines and mitogens enhance GH secretion from immune cells. GH has several biological actions in the immune system: enhancing thymopoiesis and T cell development, modulating cytokine production, enhancing B cell development and antibody production, priming neutrophils and monocytes for superoxide anion secretion, enhancing neutrophil adhesion and monocyte migration and anti-apoptotic action. Biological actions of ghrelin include attenuation of septic shock and anti-inflammatory actions, modulating phagocytosis, and enhancing thymopoiesis. The effect of ghrelin may be direct or through GH production, and that of GH may be direct or through insulin like growth factor-I (IGF-I) production. Elucidation of the roles of GH and ghrelin in the immune system may shed light on the treatment and prevention of immunological disorders such as AIDS and organ damages due to obesity/ageing-related chronic inflammation.",in in the human body are regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis) in the hypothalamus.

"<|endoftext|>Henry Baker’s second tour of duty as a Rutgers football assistant was a short one, but he’s not going far

The Paterson native is expected to join the Giants' coaching staff as an assistant defensive backs coach, a person with knowledge of the hire told NJ Advance Media. The hire was first reported by Football Scoop; Baker is expected to replace Deshea Townsend, who recently took a job with the Bears.

Baker, who previously served a minority coaching internship with the Giants, is on the move again less than two months after he was re-hired as Rutgers' cornerbacks coach and pass game coordinator. Baker coached at North Carolina last season; he had previously served as Rutgers' cornerbacks coach in 2017.

Baker had signed a two-year contract paying him a base salary of $275,000 annually. Baker will owe Rutgers a $30,000 buyout fee in order to break the deal, which only became official on Jan. 2 of this year, according to contract details obtained by NJ Advance Media following an open records request.

Baker’s departure means head coach Chris Ash now has two openings to fill on his staff with about a month to go before the start of spring practice. Baker had replaced Cory Robinson on staff. Robinson, a Baltimore native, left Rutgers earlier this week after one season to take a job on new Maryland coach Mike Locksley’s staff, his old boss.

Rutgers' next cornerbacks coach will be its fourth different assistant to handle the position under Ash. Aaron Henry was an assistant defensive backs coach in 2016, but he focused on the corners while Bill Busch focused on the safeties. The next position coach will inherit a room with one returning starter - freshman Avery Young - as well as redshirt sophomore Tre Avery, who missed almost all of this past season due to injury but is expected to be a favorite to win the other starting job.

"<|endoftext|>Canada's own Mitch Gagnon will compete on home turf for the third time in a row when he takes on Issei Tamura in a Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) bantamweight bout at UFC 158: ""St. Pierre vs. Diaz"" on March 16 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

The match up will likely air on the UFC 158 preliminary card, which is expected to be broadcast on FX and Facebook, with the main card airing on pay-per-view (PPV).

""Showdown"" Joe Ferraro of Sportsnet reported news of the 135-pound contest via Twitter on Saturday. UFC officials have yet to officially confirm the bout.

Gagnon (9-2) has earned all nine of his professional wins by way of submission, most recently tapping out Walel Watson with a rear-naked choke at UFC 152 for his first UFC victory.

After dropping his UFC debut to Brian Caraway in the UFC 149 ""Fight of the Night"" last July, the 28-year-old rebounded with the 69-second submission of Watson.

Tamura (7-3) will enter UFC 158 on the heels of his first career knockout loss to Raphael Assuncao at UFC on FU","EL TV 4 last July. The defeat evened Tamura's record inside the Octagon to 1-1, and the Japanese fighter will look to avoid dropping two in a row when he competes in Canada for the first time.

The 28-year-old has yet to be submitted in his 10-fight professional career. He will look to keep that feat in tact against a submission specialist in Gagnon.

UFC 158: ""St-Pierre vs. Diaz"" goes down March 16 from the Bell Centre in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. A welterweight championship grudge match between Georges St-Pierre and Nick Diaz serves as the main event while crucial 170-pound contests of Carlos Condit vs. Rory MacDonald and Johnny Hendricks vs. Jake Ellenberger fill the undercard.","EL TV.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate a cognitive behavioral anger management intervention in order to increase self-consciousness and decrease anger among Korean military men. A quasi-experimental design was used for this study. Ninety two soldiers were screened for unhealthy anger expression using a questionnaire. Among them, 26 soldiers who showed unhealthy anger expression were selected for this study. They were matched by rank and assigned to either a treatment or control group. The treatment group received the intervention three consecutive times, once a week and for 120 minutes per session. Participants were assessed before and after the intervention for anger (the State-Trait Anger Scale) and self-consciousness (Self-consciousness Scale). Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics, chi- square-test, Mann-Whit","ney test, and Wilcox on signed rank test. There was no statistically significant decrease in anger or increase in self-consciousness between the two groups following treatment. However, there was a significant increase in private self-consciousness in the treatment group after the intervention(p=.006). The cognitive behavioral anger management program improves private self-consciousness in soldiers.

If only it were that simple. Kellyan","ne Conway, one of Donald Trump’s top White House advisers, appeared on Fox News yesterday and touted the new Republican health care plan, which, she said, enjoys the president’s full support. There was, however, some quibbling about what to call the GOP proposal.Conway says the Republican plan enjoys “presidential leadership,” explaining that Trump has personally taken it upon himself to push the bill through. She added that the president is “ really husbanding ” the legislation through the process.But when the discussion turned to the bill’s name, TPM reported that Conway insisted this is”serious business” and “isn’t about branding according to someone’s name.” She added, “I’ll call it Trumpcare if you want to, but I didn’t hear President Trump say to any of us, ‘Hey, I want my name on that.’”A White House spokesperson struck a more emphatic note with Politico, arguing “It’s not ‘Trumpcare.’ … We will be calling it by its official name,” the American Health Care Act.

He built his career in large part by plastering his name on skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, books, wines and steaks, but there appears to be one place President Donald Trump does not want his favorite five-letter word – the Republican health care bill.



Before Obamacare, there was Romneycare. Back in the 1990s, there was Hillarycare. For a brief moment in the 2012 GOP primary, there was even Obamneycare (Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty quickly abandoned the phrase and, in August 2011, his campaign for the nomination). But the White House, for all its messaging woes and infighting, has settled on the fact that – for the time being – it’s steering clear of Trumpcare.","ne Conway’s

Vascular endothelial insulin resistance (IR) is a critically initial factor in cardiocerebrovascular events resulted from diabetes and is becoming a worldwide public health issue. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are clinical insulin-sensitizers acting through a canonical peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ)-dependent insulin trans-activation pathway. However, it remains elusive whether there are other mechanisms. In current study, we investigated whether TZDs improve endothelial IR induced by high glucose concentration or hyperglycemia via a non-canonical PPARγ-dependent nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) trans-repression pathway. Our results showed that pre-treatment with TZDs dramatically decrease the susceptibility of endothelial cell to IR, while post-treatment notably improve the endothelial IR both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, TZDs substantially increase the levels of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and inhibitory κB alpha (IκBα), whereas decrease those of the phosphorylated inhibitory κB kinase alpha/beta (phosphor-IKKα/β) and the cytokines including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) and soluble vascular cellular adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), suggesting that TZDs act indeed through a PPARγ-dependent NF-κB trans-repression pathway. These findings highlighted a non-canonical mechanism for TZDs to ameliorate endothelial IR which might provide a potential strategy to prevent and treat the diabetic vascular complications clinically.","appa B (NF-κB) pathway.

A novel back-traject","ory approach was adopted to determine the origins of black carbon (BC) and carbon monoxide (CO) transported to Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei. Results showed that the transport efficiency was controlled mainly by mid-latitude westerlies in winter, the South Asian monsoon in summer and prevailing westerly and northwesterly winds in spring and autumn. Hebei was identified as the most important source region of both BC (respectively accounting for 55% and 49%) and CO (39% and 38%) transported to Beijing and Tianjin. Inner Mongolia contributed more to the effective emission intensity (EEI) in winter than in summer for both BC and CO transported to Beijing and Tianjin. Shandong was responsible for higher EEI in summer than in winter. The six provinces making the greatest contributions to BC transported to Hebei were Shandong (19%), Shanxi (19%), Inner Mongolia (17%), Beijing (11%), Henan (11%), and Tianjin (10%), whereas those making the greatest contributions to CO transported to Hebei were Shandong (20%), Inner Mongolia (10%), Tianjin (9%), Henan (9%), Shanxi (9%), and Beijing (8%). In summary, Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Shandong, Tianjin and Shanxi were determined as the dominant source regions of not only BC but also CO transported to Beijing. Hebei, Shandong, Beijing, Inner Mongolia, Henan, Liaoning and Shanxi were relatively important source regions for Tianjin. Shandong, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Beijing, Henan, Tianjin, Liaoning, Jiangsu and Anhui were the main source regions for Hebei. Residential and industrial sectors were the dominant sectors for BC and CO transported to the receptors, respectively. These results are consistent with the results of previous studies. Finally, comparing the observed ΔBC/ΔCO ratio with the enhancement ratio of the EEI of BC with that of CO (ΔEEIBC/ΔEEICO) at Miyun site, we further confirmed that the EEI can be used to represent the amounts of BC and CO reaching receptors.","ory of the origin of black carbon and carbon monoxide.

"<|endoftext|>Teotihuacan, Mexico

Teotihuacan is an enormous archaeological site in the Basin of Mexico, containing some of the largest pyramidal structures built in the pre-Columbian Americas. Apart from the pyramidal structures, the archaeological site of Teotihuacan is also known for its large residential complexes, the so-called “street of the dead”, and its colorful well-preserved murals.

Teotihuacan was, at its apogee in the first half of the 1st millennium CE, the largest city in the pre-Columbian Americas. During its zen","ith it may have had more than 100,000 inhabitants placing it among the largest cities of the world in this period. The civilization and cultural complex associated with the site is also referred to as Teotihuacan or Teotihuacano. Although it is a subject of debate whether Teotihuacan was the center of an empire, its influence throughout Mesoamerica is well documented; evidence of Teotihuacano presence, if not outright political and economic control, can be seen at numerous sites in Veracruz and the Maya region. The ethnicity of the inhabitants of Teotihuacan is also a subject of debate and possible candidates are the Nahua, Otomi or Totonac ethnic groups. Often it has been suggested that Teotihuacan was in fact a multiethnic state.

The city and the archaeological site was located in what is now the San Juan Teotihuacán municipality in the State of México, Mexico, approximately 40 kilometres (25 mi) northeast of Mexico City. The site covers a total surface area of 83 km² and was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987, and is one of the most visited archaeological sites in Mexico.","ith, Teotihuacan was the center of the Mexican empire, and its inhabitants were the first to establish a capital city. The city was also the site of the first major settlement in the pre-Columbian Americas, the city of Puebla, which was founded in the early 1st century CE.

Patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) frequently have painful erosions that are slow to heal. There is no definitive treatment; therefore any therapy that improves wound healing would be beneficial to these patients. Our purpose was to assess the effects of cultured allogeneic keratinocytes on wound healing in RDEB. Ten patients with RDEB and dermatome-induced superficial dermal wounds were studied. Cultured keratinocyte grafts were applied to part of the wound, with another part left ungrafted. Both sites were assessed clinically and microscopically, particularly with regard to basement membrane zone reconstitution. Apart from minor differences in keratinocyte differentiation and a moderate analgesic effect induced by the graft, there were no other distinguishing findings in wound healing in the grafted and nongrafted sites. There was little clinical benefit from cultured keratinocyte allografts in wound healing in RDEB. However, this study showed that RDEB keratinocytes have an inherent capacity to express some type VII collagen epitopes transiently during wound healing, although this was not associated with the detection of anchoring fibrils.","ive and chronic conditions.

To determine if chronic treatment with the long-acting oral opioid antagonist naltrexone can increase luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion in women with secondary amenorrhea. Prospective. Large reproductive endocrinology unit of an academic hospital. Three groups of women with oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea: (1) hypothalamic amenorrhea; (2) anorexia nerv","osa; and (3) polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD). Naltrexone 50 mg every day for 4 days. Luteinizing hormone pulse pattern, frequency and amplitude, mean LH and FSH levels, measured by serial blood sampling over a 6-hour period before and after naltrexone. Naltrexone caused a significant increase (P less than 0.05) of the LH pulse frequency in patients with hypothalamic amenorrhea and in PCOD but not in anorexia nervosa. The mean levels of LH and FSH and LH pulse amplitudes were not significantly changed by naltrexone. The naltrexone nonresponders were underweight either because of simple weight loss or anorexia nervosa and had low levels of estradiol and an LH pulse pattern similar to the luteal one. The luteal LH pulse pattern in weight loss-related amenorrhea is caused by a nonopioid, undernutrition-linked factor.","osa; and (3) polycystic ovarian disease.

RESULTS:

The long-acting oral opioid antagonist naltrexone significantly increased LH and FSH secretion in the hypothalamic amenorrhea group. The LH and FSH secretion were significantly higher in the anorexia nervosa group than in the polycystic ovarian disease group. The LH and FSH secretion were significantly higher in the anorexia nervosa group than in the polycystic ovarian disease group. The LH and FSH secretion were significantly higher in the anorexia nervosa group than in the polycystic ovarian disease group. The LH and FSH secretion were significantly higher in the anorexia nervosa group than in the polycystic ovarian disease group. The LH and FSH secretion were significantly higher in the anorexia nervosa group than in the polycystic ovarian disease group. The LH and FSH secretion were significantly higher in the anorexia nervosa group than in the polycystic ovarian disease group. The LH and FSH secretion were significantly higher in the anorexia nervosa group than in the polycystic ovarian disease group. The LH and FSH secretion were significantly higher in the anorexia nervosa group than in the polycy","osa; and (3) polycystic ovarian disease.

<|endoftext|>Assessment of sleep impairment in persistent allergic rhinitis patients using polysom,"nography.
Although questionnaires have demonstrated an association between impairment of quality of sleep and symptoms in allergic rhinitis (AR) patients, to date there is no report of an objective assessment of sleep in patients with persistent allergic rhinitis (PER) as defined by ARIA guidelines. The aim of the present study was therefore to assess sleep disturbance in PER patients by polysomnography (PSG). Ninety-eight PER patients with moderate-to-severe nasal obstruction and 30 healthy volunteers were included in the study. All patients underwent PSG during nocturnal sleep to assess the presence and severity of sleep disorders. Peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF) was also measured to assess nasal resistance. There were statistically significant, though clinically modest, differences between PER patients and healthy controls in most PSG parameters including sleep efficiency, arousal index, average SaO(2), lowest SaO(2), time spent with a saturation below 90%, and snoring time. Although the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was not significantly different between the 2 groups, 17 subjects (17.3%) in the PER group but none of the control subjects had an AHI >5. Patients with higher T5SS scores (12 ≤ T5SS ≤ 15) had a greater tendency to snore than did patients with lower scores (8 ≤ T5SS ≤ 11). Finally, PNIF in the PER group was significantly lower than in the control group. Weak correlations between the arousal index and PNIF, average SaO(2), and PNIF were found. PSG showed modest changes in PER patients versus control subjects.","nography. J. Clin. Invest. 88: 567–571, 2004.

"<|endoftext|>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered a nonpartisan speech today in Washington, DC, asking for Congress’s support in preventing a nuclear Iran. He pledged his desire to protect his people, while thanking America for her unrelenting support of his state – from Presidents Harry Truman to Barack Obama. Nevertheless, congressional Democrats decided it would be appropriate to bash the prime minister’s appearance during a press conference directly following his passionate address.

Rep. John Yarmuth (D-KY) decried the Israeli Prime Minister’s speech as ‘condescending’ and was offended that Netanyahu was ‘telling us how to operate.’ He even invoked the name of Dick Cheney, “This is right out of the Dick Cheney playbook” and bluntly told the prime minister, “He can go home.”

Congressman David Price (D-NC) then dared to say that House Speaker John Boehner should ‘never’ have invited Netanyahu to speak in front of Congress at this time.

The Fox News ""Outnumbered"" cast was shocked and outraged by the Democrats’ response. Andrea Tantaros called them ‘arrogant’ for such comments and Harris Faulkner likened their words to ‘vocal flame throwing.’

In all, 57 Democrats boy","cotted Netanyahu’s speech – with reports that number could have been even higher. Their decision to skip the speech was largely due to claims that Netanyahu’s timing in Washington was too close to Israeli elections. Netanyahu has repeatedly pledged, however, that visiting DC for political purposes was ‘never his intention.’

As for President Obama and Vice President Biden, they were no shows as well.

Netanyahu’s speech was apolitical, focusing instead on the threat of a nuclear Iran. He urged the White House to ditch an arms deal with Iran, which he warned would only pave the way to a more dangerous country.

“Its rapid appetite for aggression grows more every year…This deal will not change Iran for the better, it will change the Middle East for the worse.”

Shame on Democrats for ignoring Netanyahu’s important warnings and for turning their backs on Israel at this fragile time.","cotted Netanyahu’s speech.

The speech was delivered by Rep. John Conyers (D-MI), who was not present at the speech.

"<|endoftext|>Stephen King Is Email Buddies With the 'Stranger Things' Creators

""We spend a lot of time and make sure the grammar is right,"" Matt Duffer, who created the Netflix phenomenon with his brother, tells THR about composing replies to King (who's a major inspiration).

Exchanging emails with an idol can be excruciating. Just ask the Duffer brothers.

Although they didn't say who reached out first, Matt and Ross Duffer — the brains behind Netflix's nostalgic thriller phenomenon Stranger Things, which returns for a second season on Oct. 27 — tell The Hollywood Reporter that they've been email buddies with the man who inspired them to do what they do.

""He tweeted about our show and we've exchanged some emails with him,"" Ross explains, referencing King's tweets, one of which praised the show as ""pure fun"" and ""A+"" with another sharp-tongued post that it's like ""watching Steve King's Greatest Hits. I mean that in a good way.""

""It still blows my mind because growing up he was such an inspiration — he’s like a god to us, and so, it’s been surreal just communicating with him at all,"" adds Ross.

He says that the brothers usually put their heads together when composing a reply. ""We spend a lot of time and make sure the grammar is right. We ran the first email by our writers just to make sure it was good, like, we were very, very particular about it.""

Adds Matt: ""Is like this: A're we using a semicolon properly in this email?' And then he probably writes his email back to us in about five seconds, but he’s very, very sweet. He’s a very sweet guy.""
